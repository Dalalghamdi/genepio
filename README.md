## GenEpiO

The Genomic Epidemiology Application Ontology describes the genomics, laboratory, clinical and epidemiological contextual information required to support data sharing and integration for foodborne infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigations.</h2>

##Our Mission
          
To increase the global interoperability of genomic epidemiology contextual information (genomics metadata, lab, clinical and epidemiology data) to support data sharing and integration for foodborne infectious disease surveillance outbreak investigations, as well as other public health activities. To achieve consensus and wide adoption, and to develop GenEpiO according to best practices, the consortium embraces collaborative development and open use/open source technology.
   
##GenEpiO Consortium

Recognizing that GenEpiO encompasses many domains, we have formed a consortium for enhancing its content via interested parties that need particular domain terminology. For more information on how to get involved, see the [GenEpiO Consortium](https://github.com/GenEpiO/genepio/wiki/GenEpiO-Consortium) Wiki page.

##Check it out!

There are a number of ways to explore GenEpio's content:

- GenEpiO on the [EBI Ontology Lookup Service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/genepio) provides 
    a convenient way browse its hierarchy and search for terms.</li>
  
- View GenEpiO from within the context of the [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org) family of ontologies.
    GenEpiO draws many terms from this global, community-supported ontology collection.</li>
  
- View GenEpiO using the [Stanford Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/" target="_blank) OWL ontology editor. After downloading the GenEpiO github archive files, and running Protégé, open the "genepio.owl" file and click on the Classes tab.  There you can drill-down the entity hierarchy; or use the search box in upper right to find terms.
  
- Preview our [Proof Sheet](http://tinyurl.com/uiproofsheet) application we are developing for
    previewing the data-collection and reporting elements of an ontology.
  
- Explore the [GenEpiO Upper Level Schema](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uiM1c9bsQbCLZnhpgeEEWDPKyCudnAAxdl0a1p9fKTU) spreadsheet which gives an overview of GenEpiO's scope.
  
- An [introductory slideshow](https://github.com/GenEpiO/genepio/blob/gh-pages/GenEpiOConsortiumSlideDeckSept2016.pdf) is available.

**Note that GenEpiO is under development (many terms have a curation status of "requires discussion") and its existing
  content requires a few more editing passes for proper description of terms.**
          
The [Wiki](https://github.com/GenEpiO/genepio/wiki) tab contains many details about getting involved in our Consortium; the [Issues](https://github.com/GenEpiO/genepio/issues) tab dives deep into particular design and implementation questions being resolved.

## IRIDA ontology

The Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis project (IRIDA, http://www.irida.ca) uses **genepio.owl** for most of its ontology.
